    Abstract base class for testing service components.

    Provides a structured framework for testing services that implement
    the AbstractService interface, with tests for lifecycle management,

    Features:
    - Service lifecycle testing
    - Update method testing
    - Error handling and retry testing
    - Async operation testing
    - Service configuration testing

    To use this class, extend it and override the class attributes and methods
