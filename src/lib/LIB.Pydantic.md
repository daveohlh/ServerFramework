### Forward Reference Resolution

#### String Reference Handling
Comprehensive system for resolving string forward references to actual classes.

**Resolution Strategies:**

- Model registry lookup
- Normalized name matching
- Partial name matching
- Cross-module resolution

#### Complex Type Processing
Processing of complex type annotations with forward references.

**Supported Patterns:**
- Optional[ForwardRef]
- List[ForwardRef]  
- Union[ForwardRef, Other]
- Nested generic types

### Model Registry Integration

## Usage Patterns

### Model Registry Workflow
1. Create registry instance
2. Bind models with metadata
3. Process extensions
4. Commit registry (generates schemas)
5. Attach to application

### Extension Integration
1. Register extension models
2. Apply model augmentation  
3. Resolve dependencies
4. Generate enhanced schemas

### Testing Support
1. Create isolated registry
2. Bind test-specific models
3. Generate test schemas
4. Execute isolated tests

## Best Practices

1. **Registry Management**: Use isolated registries for different application contexts
2. **Extension Integration**: Properly register extension models before commit
3. **Circular References**: Use lazy loading patterns for circular model relationships
4. **Caching**: Leverage built-in caching for performance optimization
5. **Testing**: Use isolated registries for test environments
6. **Schema Generation**: Control recursion depth for large model hierarchies
7. **Name Conflicts**: Monitor and resolve type name collisions early
